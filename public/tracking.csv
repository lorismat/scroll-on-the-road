Filled with dreams of what I’d do in Chicago, in Denver, and then finally in San Fran, I took the 7th avenue subway to the end of the line at 242nd street, right near Horace Mann the prep school where I had actually met Henri Cru;242nd street NY;1838;alone;subway;;;;;;
"and there took a trolley into Yonkers; downtown Yonkers I transferred on an outgoing trolley and went to the city limits on the east bank of the Hudson river";limits on the east bank of the Hudson river;1838;;trolley;;;;;;
I started hitching up the thing. Five scattered shot rides took me to the desired Bear Mtn. bridge where Route 6 arched in from New England.;Bear Mtn. bridge;1852;;hitchhiking;;;;;;
But they let me in, and rode me back to Newburgh which I accepted as a better alternative than being trapped in the Bear Mtn wilderness all night.;Newburgh;1852;;hitchhiking;;;;;;
"In Newburgh it had stopped raining, I walked down to the river, and among all things I had to ride back to NY in a bus with a delegation of schoolteachers (...) And I swore I’d be in Chicago tomorrow; and made sure of that, taking a bus to Chicago, spending most of my money, and didn’t give a damn, just as long as I’d be in that damned Chicago tomorrow. The bus left at 2 o’clock in the morning from the 34St. bus station";34St. bus station;257,6;;bus;;;;;;
I arrived in Chicago quite early in the morning;Chicago;258;;bus;;;;;;
The wind from Lake Michigan, the beans, bop at the Loop, long walks around So. Halsted and No. Clark and one long walk after midnight into the jungles where a cruising car followed me as a suspicious character;Chicago;258,4;;walk;staying;;;;;
To get out of the impossible complexities of Chicago traffic I took a bus to Joliet, Illinois;Joliet;259,5;;bus;;;;;;
My first ride was a dynamite truck with a red flag, about thirty miles into the great green Illinois, the truckdriver pointing out the place where Route 6 that we were on intersected Route 66 before they both shot west for incredible distances.;Intersections of road 66 / 6;259,9;;hitchhiking;;;;;;
But she was a middleaged woman, actually the mother of sons my age, and wanted somebody to help her drive to Iowa. I was all for it. Iowa!;;259,9;;hitchhiking;;;;;;
I took over the wheel, and though I’m not much of a driver drove clear through the rest of Illinois to Davenport, Iowa, via Rock Island;Davenport, Iowa;260,2;;hitchhiking;;;;;;
I took a bus in downtown Davenport, after spending a half hour watching a waitress in the bus station cafe, and rode to the city limits, but this time near the gas stations.;Davenport, Iowa;;;bus;;;;;;
Just as we rolled into Rapid City he saw another truck coming behind us, and because he had to turn off at Rapid City he blinked his tail lights at the other guy and slowed down for me to jump out;Rapid City;262,7;;hitchhiking;;;;;;
"Off we roared, and an hour later the smoke of Des Moines appeared ahead over the green cornfields. He had to eat his breakfast now and wanted to take it easy, so I went right on into Des Moines the rest of the way about four miles, hitching a ride from two boys from the U. of Iowa;";Des Moines;264,2;;hitchhiking;;;;;;
"A crazy guy with a kind of toolshack on wheels, a truck full of tools, that he drove standing up like a modern milkman, gave me a ride up the long hill; where I immediately got a ride from a farmer and his son heading out for Adel in Iowa";Adel;266,6;;hitchhiking;;;;;;
But we stuck together and got a ride from a taciturn man to Stuart Iowa, a town in which I was destined to be really stranded.;Stuart, Iowa;268;;hitchhiking;Eddie;;;;;
So when the Omaha bus came through just before dawn we hopped on it and joined the sleeping passengers---for this I spent most of the last of my few bucks, his fare as well as mine. (...) We arrived at Council Bluffs at dawn;Council Bluffs;269,2;;bus;Eddie;;;;;
Then Omaha, and by God the first cowboy I saw;Omaha;269,8;;bus;Eddie;;;;;
We got a brief ride to a further crossroads;;270,3;;hitchhiking;Eddie;;;;;
I told my soul, and the cowboy came back and off we went to Grand Island. We got there in no time flat.;Grand Island;273,5;;hitchhiking;Eddie;;;;;
We got a ride from a couple of young fellows, wranglers, teenagers, countryboys in a put-together jaloppy and were left off somewhere up the line in a thin drizzle of rain. Then an old man who said nothing and God knows why he picked us up took us to (Preston) Nebraska.;Preston, Nebraska.;274,3;;hitchhiking;Eddie;;;;;
I ran like mad. “Where you going?” “Denver.” “Well I can take you a hundred miles up the line. “Grand, grand, you saved my life.” “I used to hitch hike myself, that’s why I always pickup a fellow.”;Preston, Nebraska.;;;hitchhiking;;;;;;
I was glad when the two Minnesota farmboys in the cab decided to stop in No. Platte and eat;North Platte;282,9;;hitchhiking;;;;;;
We came suddenly into the town of Ogallala, and here the fellows in the cab called out “Pisscall!” and with great good delight;Ogallala;293,4;;hitchhiking;;;;;;
"Great crowds of businessmen, fat businessmen in boots and tengallon hats, with their hefty wives in cowgirl attire bustled and whoopeed on the wooden sidewalks of old Cheyenne; further down were the long stringy boulevard lights of new downtown Cheyenne";Cheyenne;297,4;;hitchhiking;;;;;;
"I got a ride right off from a young fellow from Connecticut who was driving around the country in his jaloppy painting; he was the son of an editor in the East. He talked and talked; I was sick from drinking and from the altitude. At one point I almost had to stick my head out the window. But I made it, and by the time he let me off at Longmont Colo.";Longmont Colo;303,8;;hitchhiking;;;;;;
The man and I had a long warm conversation about our respective schemes in life and before I knew it we were going over the Denargo fruitmarkets outside Denver, there was smoke, smokestacks, railyards, redbrick buildings and the distant downtown graystone buildings and here I was in Denver. He let me off at Larimer street.;Denver, Larimer street;305;;hitchhiking;There in Denver: Hal Chase, Ginger (Hal's girl), Allen Ginsberg, Ed White, Allan Temko, The Burfords;;;;;
Allen had a basement apartment on Grant street and we all met there many a night that went to dawn---Allen, Neal, myself, Jim Holmes, Al Hinkle and Bill Tomson. More of these others later;Denver;314,4;;stop;;;;;;
And then it all started. The following ten days were as W.C. Fields says “Fraught with eminent peril…” and mad. I moved in with Allan Temko in the really swank apartment that belonged to EdW’s folks.;Denver;316,5;;stop;in Temko's apt;;;;;
In the afternoon I was involved in that trek to the mountains and didn’t get to see Neal or Allen for five days. Beverly Burford had use of her employer’s car for the weekend. We brought suits and hung them on the windows and took off for Central City, Bob Burford driving, Ed White lounging in the back, and Beverly up front. It was my first view of the interior of the Rockies.;Central City;337;;car;Escale while in Denver;;;;;
The sun came out, and Ed White rode a trolley with me to the bus station. I bought my ticket to San Fran, spending half of the fifty, and got on at two o’clock in the afternoon. Ed White waved goodbye. The bus rolled out of the storied eager Denver streets. “By God I gotta come back and see what else will happen!”;Denver;358,4;;trolley;Leaving Denver;;;;;
The bus trip from Denver to Frisco was uneventful except that my whole soul leaped to it the nearer we got to Frisco. Cheyenne again…;Cheyenne;360,1;;bus;;;;;;
"and then went over the rangelands; crossing the Divide at midnight at Creston, arriving Salt Late City at dawn, a city of sprinklers, the least likely place for Neal to have been born;";Salt Late City;360,1;;bus;;;;;;
"then out to Nevada in the hot sun, Reno by nightfall, its twinkling Chinese streets; then up the Sierra Nevada, pines, stars, mountain lodges signifying Frisco romances";Reno;360,1;;bus;;;;;;
And Truckee itself, homey Truckee and then down the hill to the flats of Sacramento. I suddenly realized I was in California.;Sacramento;361;;bus;;;;;;
I wandered out like a haggard ghost, and there she was, Frisco, long bleak streets with trolley wires all shrouded in fog and whiteness. I stumbled about a few blocks. Weird bums (it was Mission st.) asked me for dimes in the dawn.;San Francisco;361,7;;bus;;;;;;
And following his instructions I took a bus and rode out over the Golden Gate bridge to Marin City.;Marin City;362;;bus;;;;;;
My life was wrapped in the shack, in Henri’s battles with Diane, and in the middle of the night at the barracks. Henri was gone off in the dark to get another box;Marin City;386;;stop;with Henri;;;;;
