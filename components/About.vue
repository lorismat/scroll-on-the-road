        <!-- personal comments -->
        <i>On The Road</i> became an obession as soon as I discovered it. This project is 
        an attempt to follow Jack Kerouac and Neal Cassady on their trip. 

        <br> <br> <!-- methodology and open contributions -->
        All the quotes are extracted from the original scroll edition (2007). In case you are wondering why you see the real names, 
        that is the reason. I trusted my own notes to track the different 
        locations. If you think I missed some, reach me out on Twitter or comment the public the google sheet
        I created. The road itself is based on the recommended itinerary by Google Maps from one point to another as of January 16th. 
        Some road were probably not existing at the time, making the present itinerary not fully accurate.

        <br> <br> <!-- other projects -->
        I would like to mention other projects about the book that inspired me: <br> <br>

        <a class="underline pb-2" href="http://" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">A book of the whole itinerary</a> 

        <br> <br> <!-- source code and data and copyright -->
        Below are the source code of the application, the map I created and used to draw the itinerary and the google sheet with 
        the original quotes from the text. Feel free to use any of them, but please let me know if you do! <br><br>
