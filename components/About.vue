        <!-- personal comments -->
        <i>On The Road</i> became an obession as soon as I discovered it. This project is 
        an attempt to follow Jack Kerouac and Neal Cassady on their trip. 

        <br> <br> <!-- methodology and open contributions -->
        All the quotes are extracted from the original scroll edition (2007). I trusted my own notes to track the different 
        locations. If you think I missed any city, reach me out on <a class="underline pb-2" href="https://twitter.com/lorismat_" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Twitter</a> or comment the  
        <a class="underline pb-2" href="http://" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">public google sheet</a>
        I created. The road itself is based on the recommended itinerary by Google Maps from one point to another as of January 16th. 
        Some roads were probably not existing at the time, making the present itinerary not fully accurate.

        <br> <br> <!-- other projects -->
        I would like to mention another project about the book that inspired me, the interactive 
        <a class="underline pb-2" href="http://dennismansker.com/ontheroad.htm" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Google My Maps places in On The Road</a> by 
        Dennis Mansker.
