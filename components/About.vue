        <i>On The Road</i> quickly became an obsession when I discovered it. 
        This project aims at following the journey of Jack Kerouac and Neal Cassady as depicted in the novel.

        My own notes were relied upon to track the various locations mentioned in the book. 
        Currently, a map of Mexico has yet to be added, but I am working to include it in the near future. 
        If you think I have missed any location, please feel free to reach out to me via

        of the project. 
        The road itinerary used in this project is based on the recommended route provided by Google Maps as of January 16th, 2023. 
        It should be noted that some roads may not have existed at the time the novel was written, making the present itinerary not entirely accurate.
